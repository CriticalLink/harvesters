Harvester
#########

Harvester is a Python library that consumes the GenTL Standard based image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. If you have a GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, Harvester offers you high-performance image acquisition from the cameras and visualization of the acquired images. In addition, it offers you interface for numpy to make image processing easier and productive.

Harvester is a friendly companion for people who those want to learn computer vision.

Currently, Harvester is GPL-3.0 licensed.

Why did we name the library Harvester?
######################################

Harvester's name was derived from the great Flemish painter, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting so-called "The Harvesters". Harvesters harvest a crop every season that has been fully grown and the harvested crop is passed to the consumers. On the other hand, image acquisition libraries acquire images as their crop and the images are passed to the following processes. We found the similarity between them and decided to name our library Harvester.

Apart from anything else, we love its peaceful and friendly name. We hope you also like it ;-)

The initial idea about Harvester was suddenly come up to Kazunari Kudo's head in the early April 2018 and he decided to bring the first prototype to the following International Vision Standards Meeting. During the Frankfurt International Vision Standards Meeting which was held in May 2018, people confirmed Harvester really worked using machine vision cameras provided by well-known machine vision camera manufacturers in the world. Having that fact, the attendees warmly welcomed Harvester.

The following individuals have directly or indirectly contributed to the development activity of Harvester or encouraged the developers by their thoughtful warm words:
