Harvester is a Python library that consumes the GenTL Standard based image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. If you have a GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, Harvester offers you high-performance image acquisition from the cameras and visualization of the acquired images. In addition, it offers you interface for numpy to make image processing easier and productive.

Harvester is a friendly companion for people who those want to lean computer vision.

Currently, Harvester is GPL-3.0 licensed.

Why did we name the library Harvester?
######################################

Harvester's name was derived from the great Flemish painter, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting so-called "The Harvesters". Harvesters harvest a crop every season that has been fully grown and the harvested crop is passed to the consumers. On the other hand, image acquisition libraries acquire images as their crop and the images are passed to the following processes. We found the similarity between them and decided to name our library Harvester.

Apart from anything else, we love its peaceful and friendly name. We hope you also like it ;-)
