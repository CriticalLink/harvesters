About Harvester
***************

Harvester is a friendly companion for people who those want to learn computer vision.

Technically speaking, Harvester is a Python library which is responsible for the following tasks:

* Image acquisition
* Image data visualization (optional)

Harvester consumes image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. If you have an officially certified GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, then Harvester supply you the acquired image data as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ array to make your image processing task productive.

You can freely use, modify, distribute Harvester under `Apache License-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ without worrying about the use of your software: personal, internal or commercial.

Currently, Harvester is being developed and maintained by the motivated volunteer contributors from all over the world.
